        <h3>What is I For Work?</h3>
        <p>I For Work is a mobile application available for both iOS and Android that will allow users to request for home services such as cleaning, gardening, painting, etc. All you have to do is select what you want done, give some deatils about the job, include your location, price range and preffered date and time and send in a request. Experienced Service providers in your area will see your request and reply with a quote and then you can decide who to choose. You'll also be able to communicate with your service provider to ensure the job gets done smoothly.</p>

        <h3>What makes us different?</h3>
        <p>Newly-arrived people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds are having difficulties in finding employment even for low
skilled work due to obstacles such as low English proficiency and discrimination from employers; hence
they are more likely to start a small business of their own. The project aims to provide such sole trader
business and individuals a platform where they can register and offer their services and for potential
customers to be able to find and book their services. I For Work will:</p>

        <h3>Target Market</h3>
        <p>The application is targeted towards two specific groups of people
Service Providers and Customers. Currently, the application will be marketed in the Illawarra
region; however, in the future if the application is successful and the demand for it is high, it
will be marketed to a wider audience in other parts of Australia.</p>
        <h5>Service Providers</h5>
        <p>Service providers are defined as those individuals and businesses who will register into the
application to offer their services, the registration process for service providers includes a
vetting process conducted by IMS. The application aims to mainly target refugee/migrant
background people to register as service providers. In the Wollongong area, Middle Eastern
communities constitute majority of refugee arrivals, with Syria being where the greatest
portion of refugees originate from. Most other humanitarian entrants originate from Congo,
Eritrea, and Burma. The most widely spoken languages among refugees since 2011 is Arabic,
not all of the Burmese people in Wollongong speak the Burmese language, they are mainly
from the Karenni, Karen, Kachin and Chin hill tribes and each have their own distinct
language. Swahili, French or Ewe are usually spoken by the people who originate from
African regions.

6
Among newly arrived refugees and migrants, the level of educational ability and skill they
possess varies. Some have strong English proficiency and tertiary qualifications but fail to
secure employment as they do not have any Australian work experience and/or their
qualifications are not recognised in Australia, others do not have such qualifications and
speak little to no English which makes it difficult for them to communicate with the general
community and also can lead to discrimination.</p>

<h5>Customers</h5>
<p>The customers of this application are defined as individuals from the general community,
mostly around the Illawarra region, who are seeking services such as lawn mowing, cleaning,
gardening, carpet laying and removal, etc. Customers can directly register into the
application to browse and request services. In the case of customers application will be
marketed towards people aged 20 and above, mainly homeowners and other people that
may require home services on demand. Students may make up a small percentage of
customers who may want cost effective service options.</p>
